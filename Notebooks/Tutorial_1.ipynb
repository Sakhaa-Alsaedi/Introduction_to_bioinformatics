        "\n",
        "Welcome to this Bioinformatics tutorial, where we embark on a journey through the intricate world of molecular biology. The central dogma, a concept introduced by Francis Crick in 1958, lies at the heart of understanding how the genetic information encoded in DNA orchestrates the creation of functional proteins, the workhorses of life.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the quest to comprehend the molecular intricacies of life, the central dogma serves as our guiding light. It elegantly outlines the sequential flow of genetic information: from the stable repository of instructions encoded in DNA to the dynamic world of RNA, and finally, to the synthesis of proteins. This fundamental process underpins the very essence of life, enabling the creation of diverse molecules that drive the myriad of biological processes we witness in living organisms.\n",
